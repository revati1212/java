1.c)char[]
2.a)machine code specific to each platform
3.c)main()
4.a)string
5.b)5
6.c)p
7.c)20
8.a)100
9.a)60

10)jdk=java development kit ,jdk use to run and exicute the code jdk also jave bin have libraries in jdk we have JRE jre means =java runtime environment in jre it have a libraries. in jre it have JVM=java virtual machine 

11)jvm operations are run and exicute the code and it have jdk,jvm,jit.and also byte code to convert.

12)java is platform independent because in java we can run code once and after we can run it in any flatform,write one time and run it in anyflatform

13)class is a keword, and class is also a non premitive dada type
where class is taken  name in program without class cant run the program. it is instance of class.

14)there are 48 keywords in java for ex:public,private,static,class,if,else,boolean,instanceof,while,do,for,constant,case,dynamic,while,void,enum,main

15)variable is used to store the data or values and variable change the one location to another location.in variable we have 4 types those are local variable,parameter,static,non static,

16)local variable means it declare within the body of the method 
for ex:class Clz{
public static void main(String[] args){
int numbers=134;//here number is variable//
}}


17)there are two data types 1)premitive data type 2) non premitive data type
premitive:in premitive data types we have 8 data types those are int,float,char,double,byte,long,short,boolean.
non premitive:in non premitive data type java have infinite data types for example String,arrya.....

18)main is a keyword in java and main mathod means in main method we declare the parameters,
withod main we cant run the program,public static void main(String[] args) here public= means access specifier and sratic= is non access specifier and void= means return type. (String[] args)= is parameters. args=arguments

19)static is keyword and static is non access specifier.
class rev{
static void name(){
name(akash);
}

20)class odd_even(num):{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    if (num / 2 == 0:)
        System.out.println(num + "is even.");
    else:
        System.out.println(num +" is odd.");
}
}
